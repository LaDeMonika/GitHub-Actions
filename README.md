# GitHub-Actions
Repository dedicated to learning GitHub Actions and CI/CD workflows.


# What is GitHub Action
It's an automation system built into GitHub

It runs workflows:

- A workflow = a set of steps that run automatically
- Triggered by events like:
    - push
    - pull_request

### Key words

- **Workflow** = automated process (like a script)
- **YAML** = config language (.yml files)
- **Job** = one task group inside a workflow
- **Step** = one command inside a job
- **Runner** = the machine that runs your code (Linux VM)

### Folder rule

All workflows live here: `.github/workflows/`
